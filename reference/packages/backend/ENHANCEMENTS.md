# Meqenet Backend Enhancements

This document outlines the recent enhancements made to the Meqenet backend to improve security, performance, and functionality.

## 1. Fraud Detection System

A comprehensive fraud detection system has been implemented to monitor transactions and flag suspicious activities based on predefined rules and patterns.

### Features

- **Transaction Rules Engine**: Evaluates transactions against a set of fraud rules
- **User Behavior Analysis**: Calculates risk scores based on user behavior and history
- **Real-time Fraud Checks**: Integrated with transaction processing flow
- **Admin Dashboard**: View fraud statistics and manage flagged transactions
- **Configurable Risk Thresholds**: Customize risk thresholds for different actions

### Configuration

```
# Fraud detection configuration
FRAUD_HIGH_RISK_THRESHOLD=80
FRAUD_MEDIUM_RISK_THRESHOLD=50
```

### Usage

The fraud detection system is automatically integrated with the transaction processing flow. When a user initiates a payment, the system will:

1. Check the transaction against fraud rules
2. Calculate a risk score
3. Determine the appropriate action (allow, flag, or block)
4. Log the result and notify administrators if necessary

## 2. Enhanced KYC Process

The KYC verification process has been improved with document validation, face matching, and an admin review workflow.

### Features

- **Document Validation**: Validates ID documents for authenticity
- **Face Matching**: Compares selfie with ID document photo
- **Liveness Detection**: Ensures selfie is of a live person
- **Admin Review Workflow**: Streamlined process for reviewing KYC submissions
- **KYC Dashboard**: View KYC statistics and manage verifications

### Configuration

No specific configuration is required for the enhanced KYC process.

### Usage

The KYC process now includes automated checks before manual review:

1. User submits KYC documents (ID and selfie)
2. System validates documents and performs face matching
3. Results are stored with the KYC submission
4. Admin reviews the submission and automated check results
5. Admin approves or rejects the KYC submission

## 3. Late Payment Handling

A comprehensive late payment system has been implemented with notifications, grace periods, and payment rescheduling.

### Features

- **Automated Late Payment Detection**: Daily check for overdue payments
- **Grace Period**: Configurable grace period before marking as late
- **Late Fee Calculation**: Automatic calculation of late fees
- **Payment Rescheduling**: Allow users to reschedule payments
- **Default Handling**: Process for handling defaulted payments
- **Admin Dashboard**: View and manage late payments

### Configuration

```
# Late payment configuration
PAYMENT_GRACE_PERIOD_DAYS=3
PAYMENT_DEFAULT_PERIOD_DAYS=30
LATE_FEE_PERCENTAGE=5
MAX_RESCHEDULES_ALLOWED=3
RESCHEDULE_FEE_PERCENTAGE=2
```

### Usage

The late payment system automatically runs daily to check for overdue payments:

1. If a payment is overdue but within the grace period, a reminder is sent
2. If a payment is beyond the grace period, it's marked as late and a late fee is applied
3. If a payment is significantly overdue, it's marked as defaulted
4. Users can reschedule payments (with limits and fees)
5. Admins can view and manage late payments

## 4. Caching and Performance Optimization

Redis caching has been added for frequently accessed data, and database queries have been optimized.

### Features

- **Redis Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data
- **Database Optimization**: Regular database maintenance
- **Query Performance Analysis**: Tools for analyzing query performance
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track system performance metrics

### Configuration

```
# Cache configuration
ENABLE_CACHE=true
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=
REDIS_DB=0
CACHE_TTL=3600
CACHE_MAX_ITEMS=100
USE_MEMORY_CACHE=false

# Database optimization
ENABLE_DB_OPTIMIZATION=false
LOG_RETENTION_DAYS=90
```

### Usage

Caching is automatically applied to appropriate endpoints. Database optimization runs as a scheduled job.

## 5. Comprehensive Logging and Monitoring

Structured logging with correlation IDs and monitoring endpoints have been implemented.

### Features

- **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted logs with context
- **Request Correlation**: Track requests across services
- **Error Tracking**: Detailed error logging
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track system performance
- **Health Checks**: Endpoint for system health status
- **Log Rotation**: Automatic log rotation and cleanup

### Configuration

```
# Logging configuration
LOG_LEVELS=error,warn,log
LOG_LEVEL=info
LOG_DIR=logs
LOG_MAX_FILES=30d
ENABLE_DB_LOGGING=false

# Monitoring configuration
ENABLE_PERFORMANCE_MONITORING=true
METRICS_RETENTION_DAYS=7
```

### Usage

Logging and monitoring are automatically applied to the application. Health checks are available at `/api/v1/monitoring/health`.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies for these enhancements:

```bash
npm install cache-manager cache-manager-redis-store winston winston-daily-rotate-file @nestjs/schedule
```

## Database Migrations

Run the following command to apply the database migrations for these enhancements:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

This will apply the migrations for the fraud detection system, system logs, and other enhancements.

## Testing

To test these enhancements, run the following command:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

This will run the end-to-end tests for the application, including tests for the new features.
