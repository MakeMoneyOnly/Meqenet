# OWASP Dependency Check Configuration

## Overview

This directory contains configuration for OWASP Dependency Check, which is used to scan for security vulnerabilities in the Meqenet fintech application's dependencies.

## Security Strategy

### No Suppression Policy

**IMPORTANT**: Meqenet follows a strict "No Suppression" policy for dependency vulnerabilities. All vulnerabilities must be resolved through:

1. **Dependency Updates**: Upgrading to secure versions of dependencies
2. **Code Changes**: Implementing workarounds or alternative solutions
3. **Architecture Changes**: Modifying application architecture to eliminate risks

### React Native Security Approach

Our security strategy focuses on actual vulnerability resolution rather than suppression:

1. **Version Pinning**: All dependencies use exact version numbers for deterministic builds
2. **Regular Updates**: Dependencies updated to latest secure versions
3. **Security-First Development**: Security considerations built into development process
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Automated security testing and validation

### Vulnerability Resolution Methods

#### For React Native Framework Issues
- Update to latest stable React Native version with security patches
- Implement security patches from React Native security advisories
- Use React Native's built-in security features and configurations

#### For Third-Party Dependencies
- Update to latest secure versions immediately when available
- Replace vulnerable dependencies with secure alternatives
- Implement security wrappers or patches when updates aren't available

#### For ICU/DoubleConversion Issues
- These are resolved through React Native version updates
- Modern React Native versions include security patches for these libraries
- No suppressions used - actual security fixes implemented

## Enterprise Security Standards

### FinTech Compliance
- **PCI DSS**: Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard compliance
- **GDPR**: General Data Protection Regulation compliance
- **NBE**: National Bank of Ethiopia regulatory requirements

### Security Controls
- **Zero Suppression Policy**: No vulnerability suppressions allowed
- **Automated Security Scanning**: Daily vulnerability scans in CI/CD
- **Security Gates**: Builds fail on CVSS score >= 9.0 vulnerabilities
- **Dependency Auditing**: Regular dependency security audits

## Maintenance

### Vulnerability Management Process
1. **Daily Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline
2. **Immediate Action**: High/Critical vulnerabilities addressed immediately
3. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify why vulnerabilities weren't caught earlier
4. **Prevention**: Implement measures to prevent similar issues

### Dependency Update Process
1. **Security Monitoring**: Monitor for new dependency vulnerabilities
2. **Impact Assessment**: Assess impact on application functionality
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of dependency updates
4. **Deployment**: Staged rollout with monitoring

### Security Review Process
1. **Code Reviews**: All dependency changes require security review
2. **Architecture Review**: Major dependency changes reviewed by architecture team
3. **Security Testing**: Updated dependencies undergo security testing
4. **Documentation**: All changes documented with security considerations
