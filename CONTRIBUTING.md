# Contributing to Meqenet.et

Welcome to the Meqenet.et development team! This guide outlines our development process,
architectural principles, and coding standards for Ethiopia's leading BNPL financial super-app. All
team members, contractors, and consultants must follow these guidelines.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have:

- **Node.js 18+** (LTS version)
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**
- **Git** with proper configuration
- **AWS CLI** configured (for infrastructure work)
- **Understanding** of TypeScript, React Native, and NestJS

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Clone Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/meqenet/meqenet.git
   cd meqenet
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Environment Setup**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Configure your environment variables
   ```

4. **Start Development Stack**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   pnpm run dev
   ```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guidelines

### Microservice Architecture Principles

Meqenet.et follows a **Microservice Architecture** with strict governance principles:

- **Single Responsibility**: Each service handles one business capability
- **Bounded Context**: Services are designed around specific business domains
- **Explicit APIs**: All communication through well-defined, versioned APIs
- **Database Per Service**: No shared databases between services
- **Independent Deployability**: Services can be deployed independently

### Feature-Sliced Architecture (FSA)

All code MUST follow **Feature-Sliced Architecture** patterns:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/           # Application initialization, providers, router
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/         # Route components, page layouts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ widgets/       # Composite UI components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features/      # Business features (auth, bnpl, marketplace, rewards)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ entities/      # Business entities and their logic
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/        # Reusable utilities, UI kit, API clients
```

#### FSA Rules (MANDATORY)

- **Dependency Direction**: `app` ‚Üí `pages` ‚Üí `widgets` ‚Üí `features` ‚Üí `entities` ‚Üí `shared`
- **Feature Isolation**: Features can only import from `shared`, `entities`, or their own modules
- **Public API**: Each feature must expose a clean API via `index.ts`
- **No Cross-Feature Imports**: Features cannot directly import from other features

#### Core Features

- `auth` - Authentication and identity management (Fayda integration)
- `bnpl` - Buy Now, Pay Later payment logic
- `marketplace` - Product catalog and merchant management
- `rewards` - Cashback and loyalty system
- `analytics` - Business intelligence and reporting
- `kyc` - Know Your Customer verification
- `payments` - Payment processing and gateway integration
- `credit` - Credit scoring and risk assessment
- `premium` - Meqenet Plus subscription features

### Backend Code Structure (DDD-Lite)

All backend microservices **MUST** adopt a simplified Domain-Driven Design (DDD-lite) structure. This organizes code by its technical and business purpose, improving maintainability and separation of concerns.

- **`domain`**: Contains the core business logic, entities, and services. This layer is pure and has no knowledge of the infrastructure.
- **`application`**: Orchestrates use cases by interacting with the domain layer.
- **`infrastructure`**: Contains adapters for external systems like databases (Prisma), message queues, and third-party APIs.
- **`presentation`**: The entry point to the service, containing controllers (for REST/gRPC) and DTOs. This is the only layer that interacts with the network.

## üîí Security Requirements

### Zero Trust Security Model

All contributions MUST adhere to our **Zero Trust Security** framework:

#### Input Validation & Sanitization

- **Validate ALL inputs** using Zod/Joi schemas
- **Sanitize** user-provided data before processing
- **Encode outputs** to prevent XSS attacks

#### Authentication & Authorization

- **Multi-Factor Authentication** for all sensitive operations
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** implementation
- **Secure session management** with JWT tokens

#### Data Protection

- **Encrypt sensitive data** at rest (AES-256-GCM) and in transit (TLS 1.3)
- **Fayda National ID data** requires highest security classification
- **No secrets in code** - use AWS Secrets Manager

#### Microservice Communication

- **Mutual TLS (mTLS)** mandatory for service-to-service communication
- **Network policies** with default-deny approach
- **Service mesh** for advanced traffic management

## üíª Development Standards

### Code Quality

#### TypeScript Standards

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Strict typing with interfaces
interface PaymentRequest {
  amount: number;
  currency: 'ETB';
  paymentMethod: PaymentMethod;
  merchantId: string;
}

// ‚ùå Bad: Any types or loose typing
function processPayment(data: any): any {
  // Implementation
}
```

#### Feature-Sliced Organization

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Clean feature public API
// features/bnpl/index.ts
export { BNPLProvider } from './providers';
export { useBNPLCalculation } from './hooks';
export type { PaymentPlan, InstallmentSchedule } from './types';

// ‚úÖ Good: Proper imports
// features/marketplace/components/ProductCard.tsx
import { Button } from 'shared/ui';
import { Product } from 'entities/product';
import { useBNPLCalculation } from 'features/bnpl';

// ‚ùå Bad: Cross-feature imports
import { RewardsCalculator } from 'features/rewards/utils'; // ‚ùå Not allowed
```

### API Design Standards

#### OpenAPI 3.0 Specification

All external APIs MUST be defined using OpenAPI 3.0:

```yaml
# openapi.yaml (mandatory for each service)
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: Payment Service API
  version: v1
  description: BNPL payment processing service

paths:
  /v1/payments:
    post:
      summary: Process BNPL payment
      security:
        - BearerAuth: []
      requestBody:
        required: true
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/PaymentRequest'
```

#### gRPC for Internal Communication

```protobuf
// payment.proto
syntax = "proto3";

package meqenet.payment.v1;

service PaymentService {
  rpc ProcessPayment(PaymentRequest) returns (PaymentResponse);
  rpc GetPaymentStatus(PaymentStatusRequest) returns (PaymentStatusResponse);
}

message PaymentRequest {
  string user_id = 1;
  int64 amount_cents = 2;
  string merchant_id = 3;
  PaymentMethod payment_method = 4;
}
```

### Testing Requirements

#### Test Pyramid

- **Unit Tests**: 70% coverage minimum
- **Integration Tests**: Critical API endpoints
- **End-to-End Tests**: User journeys

#### Security Testing

```typescript
// Security test example
describe('Payment API Security', () => {
  it('should reject requests without authentication', async () => {
    const response = await request(app).post('/v1/payments').send(validPaymentData);

    expect(response.status).toBe(401);
  });

  it('should validate input data', async () => {
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/v1/payments')
      .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${validToken}`)
      .send({ amount: -100 }); // Invalid negative amount

    expect(response.status).toBe(400);
  });
});
```

## üåç Ethiopian Compliance

### Fayda National ID Integration

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Exclusive Fayda ID verification
interface KYCVerification {
  faydaIdNumber: string;
  biometricData: EncryptedBiometric;
  verificationStatus: 'pending' | 'verified' | 'rejected';
}

// ‚ùå Bad: Supporting other ID types
interface KYCVerification {
  idType: 'fayda' | 'passport' | 'other'; // ‚ùå Not allowed
}
```

### NBE Compliance

- **Regulatory reporting** functionality must be included
- **Audit trails** for all financial transactions
- **Data residency** requirements for Ethiopian citizen data

### Localization Requirements

- **Amharic language** support in all user-facing features
- **Ethiopian calendar** integration
- **Cultural adaptation** in UI/UX design

### 5. Commit Message and Signing Rules

#### Conventional Commits

This project follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
specification. All commit messages **MUST** adhere to this format. This ensures a meaningful and
machine-readable commit history, which enables automated changelog generation and semantic
versioning.
