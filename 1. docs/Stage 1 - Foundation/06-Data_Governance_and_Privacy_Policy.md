# 06. Data Governance and Privacy Policy

_This document is a placeholder for the full Data Governance and Privacy Policy. It will be
populated with comprehensive details in a subsequent task._

## 1. Overview

This policy defines the principles, roles, and responsibilities for managing and protecting
Meqenet's data assets. It ensures data is accurate, secure, and used ethically and in compliance
with Ethiopian law and global best practices.

## 2. Data Governance in a Microservice Architecture

Our microservice architecture requires a specific approach to data governance that balances service
autonomy with centralized control.

- **Decentralized Data Ownership**: The core principle is that **each microservice owns its domain
  data**. The team that owns a service is the steward of that data and is responsible for its
  quality, security, and lifecycle. Direct access to a service's database from another service is
  strictly forbidden.
- **Data Exchange via APIs and Events**: All data sharing between services **MUST** happen through
  well-defined APIs (for synchronous requests) or through events on a message bus (for asynchronous
  communication).
- **Data Contracts**: These APIs and event schemas serve as formal "Data Contracts." Any change to a
  data schema that is not backward-compatible is a breaking change and must be versioned and managed
  carefully to avoid disrupting downstream consumers.
- **Centralized Governance, Decentralized Enforcement**: While data ownership is decentralized, the
  overall governance policies (like this one) are centralized. All service teams are responsible for
  enforcing these central policies (e.g., for data classification, privacy, and retention) within
  their specific service domains.
- **Data Lineage**: We will implement tooling and practices to track data lineage. It is critical to
  understand how data flows between services for impact analysis, debugging, and regulatory
  compliance.

## 3. Key Areas to be Defined

- Data Classification (Public, Internal, Confidential, PII)
- Data Ownership and Stewardship (assigning specific owners to each data domain/microservice)
- Data Lifecycle Management (Creation, Storage, Usage, Archival, Deletion)
- Data Quality Standards
- Data Access Control (policies for user and service-level access)
- Privacy Principles & Data Subject Rights (DSR)
- Data Retention and Deletion Schedules
