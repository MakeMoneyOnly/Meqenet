# Database Strategy & Design Principles

## Overview

This document outlines the database strategy and design principles for the Meqenet BNPL financial
ecosystem, covering data architecture decisions, governance principles, and compliance requirements.
The design supports **all four payment options** from our business model: Pay in 4 (interest-free),
Pay in 30 (interest-free), Pay Over Time (6-24 months with 15-22% APR), and Pay in Full Today with
buyer protection.

**Feature-Sliced Architecture Database Design:** The database strategy aligns with FSA principles,
ensuring clear data ownership boundaries while maintaining referential integrity and transactional
consistency across the entire ecosystem. Each feature (`auth`, `bnpl`, `marketplace`, `rewards`,
`kyc`, `credit`, `analytics`, `premium`, `virtual-cards`, `qr-payments`) has dedicated data domains
while sharing common entities through well-defined relationships.

## 1. Database Architecture Strategy

### 1.1 Technology Stack

- **Primary Database:** PostgreSQL 15+ for ACID compliance and complex financial transactions
- **Caching Layer:** Redis 7+ for session management, real-time data, and performance optimization
- **Search Engine:** Elasticsearch 8+ for product discovery, merchant search, and analytics
- **Time-Series Database:** InfluxDB for metrics, analytics, and monitoring data
- **Data Warehouse:** Snowflake/BigQuery for advanced analytics and business intelligence
- **Graph Database:** Neo4j for recommendation engine and social features (future consideration)

### 1.2 Data Distribution & Architecture Strategy

Our database strategy is fundamentally aligned with our microservice architecture. We embrace
**decentralized data management**, where each microservice is the single source of truth for its
specific business domain. This prevents the creation of a monolithic database bottleneck and is key
to achieving service autonomy and scalability.

- **Database per Microservice**: This is the core principle. Each microservice encapsulates and owns
  its own private database. The choice of database technology (e.g., PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB) is
  optimized for the specific needs of that service. **Direct access to another service's database is
  strictly forbidden.**
- **Data Synchronization via Events**: To maintain data consistency across services, we use an
  event-driven approach. When a service updates its data, it publishes a domain event. Other
  interested services subscribe to these events to update their own local data caches or trigger
  relevant processes. This ensures loose coupling.
- **Shared Reference Data**: Common, relatively static data (like country codes or currency lists)
  can be replicated across services or managed in a dedicated, highly-available service to avoid
  repetitive lookups.
- **Read Replicas for Analytics**: To prevent analytical queries from impacting transactional
  workloads, services can expose dedicated read replicas of their databases for reporting and
  business intelligence purposes.
- **Sharding Strategy**: For high-volume services, horizontal partitioning (sharding) of the
  database will be implemented to ensure performance and scalability.

### 1.3 Data Architecture Principles

- **Single Source of Truth:** Each piece of data has one and only one owning microservice.
- **Domain-Driven Design:** Data models are designed around the business capabilities of each
  microservice.
- **API-Only Data Access:** All data access between services must occur through well-defined,
  versioned APIs. This prevents direct database coupling and creates a stable integration contract.
- **Event Sourcing:** For critical financial operations, we will store the full sequence of
  state-changing events as an immutable log, providing a complete and verifiable audit trail.
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):** For services with complex read requirements,
  we will separate the models used for writing data (commands) from those used for reading data
  (queries) to optimize performance and scalability.
