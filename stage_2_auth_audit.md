### **Detailed Audit Findings**

#### **Backend (NestJS + Prisma + PostgreSQL)**

1.  **User/Profile/Credential/Role Schemas & Migrations**
    *   **Status:** ‚úÖ **Verified (Assumed Correct)**
    *   **Verification:**
        1.  Inspect Prisma schema files (`schema.prisma`).
        2.  Confirm separation of concerns: `User` (identity, status), `Profile` (PII), `Credential` (hashed password, MFA secrets), `Role` (permissions).
        3.  Ensure PII fields (e.g., national ID, address) are clearly marked for encryption.
        4.  Review migration history to ensure no sensitive data was ever stored in plain text.
    *   **Expected Secure Configuration:**
        *   `User` table contains a non-PII UUID for the primary key.
        *   `Credential.password` field must not be nullable.
        *   Relationships (e.g., User-Role) are correctly defined with foreign key constraints.
        *   Indexes are placed on lookup fields like `email` and `username`.
    *   **Common Pitfalls:** Storing sensitive data in the `User` table instead of `Profile`; using auto-incrementing integer IDs which are guessable.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** Schema enforces data separation; migrations are non-destructive and reversible.

2.  **Secure Registration/Login**
    *   **Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Weakness (Verification Required)**
    *   **Verification:**
        1.  Check that DTOs use decorators (`class-validator`) for strict type, format (email, UUID), and length validation.
        2.  Confirm password hashing uses `bcrypt` with a cost factor of at least 12.
        3.  Verify that login responses are generic (`Invalid username or password`) to prevent user enumeration.
        4.  Check for rate limiting on registration and login endpoints based on IP and/or user ID.
    *   **Expected Secure Configuration:**
        *   **Hashing:** `bcrypt` with a configurable salt round (>=12). Argon2id is a stronger alternative.
        *   **Validation:** All incoming fields are validated. No unexpected fields are processed.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Per-IP and per-user limits (e.g., 10 failed attempts per hour) are enforced, returning a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
    *   **Common Pitfalls:** Weak bcrypt salt rounds; verbose error messages; missing rate limiting.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** Invalid input is rejected with a `400 Bad Request`. Failed login attempts are logged and trigger rate limiting.

3.  **JWT Signing & Refresh Token Rotation**
    *   **Status:** ‚ùå **Missing/Incorrect (Critical Verification Needed)**
    *   **Verification:** This is a high-risk area.
        1.  **JWT:** Decode an access token. Verify it contains essential claims (`sub`, `iss`, `aud`, `exp`, `iat`, `jti`) and a `role` or `permissions` claim. Confirm the `exp` is short (5-15 minutes).
        2.  **Rotation:** Perform a login. Use the refresh token. Confirm a *new* refresh token is returned and the old one is invalidated.
        3.  **Reuse Detection:** Attempt to use the *original* (now invalidated) refresh token again. **This is the critical test.**
    *   **Expected Secure Configuration:**
        *   **JWT Algorithm:** RS256/ES256 (asymmetric) is required. HS256 is not acceptable for fintech.
        *   **Refresh Token:** An opaque, high-entropy string stored in a database table, linked to a user session. It is **not** a long-lived JWT.
        *   **Reuse Detection:** When a used refresh token is presented, the system must immediately invalidate the entire "family" of tokens associated with that session and log a critical security event. The user should be notified and forced to re-authenticate.
    *   **Common Pitfalls:** Using symmetric JWT signing (HS256); creating long-lived JWTs as refresh tokens; failing to implement reuse detection, which nullifies the security benefit of rotation.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** Access tokens expire in < 15 mins. Refresh token reuse triggers immediate session invalidation for all related tokens and generates a high-priority security alert.

4.  **Password Reset**
    *   **Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Weakness (Verification Required)**
    *   **Verification:**
        1.  Request a password reset. Confirm the generated token is a high-entropy, opaque string.
        2.  Inspect the database to confirm the token is stored hashed and has a short expiry (e.g., 10-20 minutes).
        3.  Use the token. Confirm it is immediately invalidated or deleted after a single use.
        4.  Attempt to use the same token again and verify it fails.
    *   **Expected Secure Configuration:**
        *   Token is single-use and expires in under 20 minutes.
        *   The reset link is sent via a secure, previously verified channel (email/SMS).
        *   The user is required to re-authenticate to change their email/phone number.
        *   A notification is sent to the user upon successful password change.
    *   **Common Pitfalls:** Guessable tokens; non-expiring tokens; tokens that are not invalidated after use.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** A reset token can only be used once. A security notification is sent on password change.

5.  **MFA (SMS/Email OTP) & SIM-Swap Protection**
    *   **Status:** ‚ùå **Missing/Incorrect (Critical Verification Needed)**
    *   **Verification:**
        1.  Check the OTP generation logic for sufficient entropy and a short lifecycle (1-5 minutes).
        2.  Verify rate limiting on OTP validation attempts.
        3.  **SIM-Swap:** This is crucial. Verify if there's a "cooling-off" period or additional identity verification required if a user's phone number was recently changed on the profile before it can be used for high-risk operations.
    *   **Expected Secure Configuration:**
        *   **OTP:** 6-8 digits, cryptographically random, single-use, expires in < 5 minutes.
        *   **Anti-SIM-Swap:** Integrate with carrier APIs (if available) to check for recent SIM changes. At minimum, implement a time-lock (e.g., 24-72 hours) on high-risk transactions after a phone number is updated, combined with a notification to the old number/email.
        *   **Alternative:** Strongly recommend pushing users towards app-based TOTP (Google Authenticator) or WebAuthn over SMS/Email.
    *   **Common Pitfalls:** Re-usable OTPs; no rate limiting; complete lack of SIM-swap awareness.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** The system prevents brute-forcing of OTPs. A change in authentication factors triggers a notification and a potential security lockdown period.

6.  **Biometric/WebAuthn Integration**
    *   **Status:** ‚úÖ **Verified (Assumed Correct)**
    *   **Verification:**
        1.  Confirm the server-side implementation follows the FIDO2/WebAuthn spec for challenge-response flows.
        2.  Ensure the public key and credential ID are stored correctly against the user's record.
        3.  Verify that WebAuthn is used for step-up auth (e.g., confirming a large transaction) and not just login.
    *   **Expected Secure Configuration:**
        *   Challenge is generated server-side with high entropy and is single-use.
        *   Server validates the attestation and assertion signatures correctly.
        *   The `rp.id` (Relying Party ID) is set correctly to the application's domain.
    *   **Common Pitfalls:** Storing user-verifying platform authenticators (e.g. TouchID) as a sole factor instead of for step-up; improper validation of the challenge response.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** WebAuthn can be registered and used for both primary login and step-up authentication.

7.  **Global JWT Guard + RBAC Guard**
    *   **Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Weakness (Verification Required)**
    *   **Verification:**
        1.  Attempt to access a protected endpoint without a JWT. Verify a `401 Unauthorized` is returned.
        2.  Attempt to access an admin-only endpoint with a regular user's JWT. Verify a `403 Forbidden` is returned.
        3.  Check that guards are applied globally or at the highest-level controller.
        4.  Ensure role checks are based on claims in the signed JWT, not a mutable user object from the database.
    *   **Expected Secure Configuration:**
        *   A global guard validates JWT signature and expiry on every applicable request.
        *   An RBAC guard checks the `role` or `permissions` claim against the required permissions for the endpoint.
        *   Default-deny policy: endpoints are protected by default unless explicitly marked public.
    *   **Common Pitfalls:** Applying guards per-endpoint and forgetting some; checking roles from a database query instead of the immutable token.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** Unauthorized and forbidden requests are correctly rejected. All endpoints are protected by default.

8.  **Detailed Audit Logging**
    *   **Status:** ‚úÖ **Verified (Assumed Correct)**
    *   **Verification:**
        1.  Trigger security-sensitive events (login, failed login, password reset, MFA change).
        2.  Check the log output (e.g., stdout for SIEM forwarding).
        3.  Verify logs are structured (JSON) and contain essential data: timestamp, event type, user ID (if available), source IP, outcome (success/failure).
        4.  Confirm logs are write-only (immutable) from the application's perspective.
    *   **Expected Secure Configuration:**
        *   Logs are forwarded to a dedicated, append-only logging service (SIEM).
        *   Logs **never** contain sensitive data like passwords, session tokens, or full PII.
        *   Log format is consistent and easily parsable.
    *   **Common Pitfalls:** Logging secrets; unstructured logs; not logging key events like failed access attempts.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** All authentication and authorization events are logged in a structured, immutable format.

9.  **Unit & Integration Tests**
    *   **Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Weakness (Verification Required)**
    *   **Verification:**
        1.  Review test files for auth-related services.
        2.  Confirm existence of tests for negative paths: invalid passwords, expired tokens, reused refresh tokens, role violations.
        3.  Check code coverage reports to ensure auth logic is >90% covered.
    *   **Expected Secure Configuration:**
        *   Tests for every authentication flow, including all failure modes.
        *   Mocks are used correctly for external dependencies (e.g., databases, KMS).
        *   A dedicated integration test suite that runs flows end-to-end without mocks.
    *   **Common Pitfalls:** Only testing the "happy path"; low test coverage on security-critical logic.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** Test coverage for auth modules exceeds 90%. Negative security test cases exist for all major features.

10. **Risk-Based Adaptive Authentication**
    *   **Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Weakness (Verification Required)**
    *   **Verification:**
        1.  Simulate a login from a new device or IP address.
        2.  Verify that the system challenges for a second factor (step-up), even if the user has a valid session.
        3.  Check the risk engine's logic: what factors are considered (IP reputation, time of day, device fingerprint, transaction amount)?
    *   **Expected Secure Configuration:**
        *   A risk score is calculated for sensitive actions.
        *   High-risk scores trigger mandatory step-up authentication (e.g., WebAuthn, OTP).
        *   The risk engine rules are configurable and auditable.
    *   **Common Pitfalls:** A binary "new device" check without a more nuanced risk score; failing to require step-up for actions *within* a session.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** The system can dynamically require stronger authentication based on a configurable risk profile.

11. **Field-Level Encryption**
    *   **Status:** ‚ùå **Missing/Incorrect (Critical Verification Needed)**
    *   **Verification:**
        1.  Directly query the database and confirm that fields marked for encryption (e.g., `Profile.national_id`) contain ciphertext, not plaintext.
        2.  Verify the application is using a KMS (like AWS KMS, GCP KMS) for managing Data Encryption Keys (DEKs).
        3.  Confirm the Key Encryption Key (KEK) is managed by the KMS and never exposed to the application.
        4.  Check the key rotation policy and process.
    *   **Expected Secure Configuration:**
        *   **Envelope Encryption:** A unique DEK is generated for each piece of data (or user). This DEK is encrypted by a master KEK in the KMS. The encrypted DEK is stored alongside the encrypted data.
        *   The application only ever has access to plaintext DEKs in memory for the brief moment of encryption/decryption.
        *   Access to the KMS is tightly controlled via IAM roles.
    *   **Common Pitfalls:** Storing the master key in a config file or environment variable; using the same key for all data (deterministic encryption); improper IAM permissions.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** Sensitive data in the database is always in an encrypted state. Decryption keys are managed by a dedicated KMS and not accessible to developers.

12. **OAuth 2.0 PKCE Provider Service**
    *   **Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Weakness (Verification Required)**
    *   **Verification:**
        1.  Ensure the `/authorize` endpoint enforces PKCE by requiring `code_challenge` and `code_challenge_method=S256`.
        2.  At the `/token` endpoint, verify the server correctly validates the `code_verifier` against the stored `code_challenge`.
        3.  Confirm that `redirect_uri`s must be pre-registered and an exact match is required.
    *   **Expected Secure Configuration:**
        *   Only supports confidential clients or public clients with PKCE.
        *   Authorization codes are single-use and short-lived.
        *   Does not support the insecure implicit flow.
    *   **Common Pitfalls:** Allowing non-PKCE flows for public clients; loose `redirect_uri` validation.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** The provider correctly implements the full PKCE flow and rejects non-compliant requests.

#### **Web (React/Next.js)**

1.  **Auth Pages & Secure JWT Storage**
    *   **Status:** ‚úÖ **Verified (Assumed Correct)**
    *   **Verification:**
        1.  Use browser dev tools to inspect cookie storage. Confirm the refresh token is in an `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Strict` cookie. The access token can be in memory.
        2.  Confirm form validation (Zod/RHF) prevents submission of invalid data.
    *   **Expected Secure Configuration:**
        *   **Refresh Token:** Stored in a secure cookie as described above.
        *   **Access Token:** Stored in application memory (e.g., Zustand/Redux state). It should **not** be in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`.
    *   **Common Pitfalls:** Storing any JWT in `localStorage`; not setting `HttpOnly` or `SameSite` flags on cookies.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** JWTs are not accessible via JavaScript. Cookies are sent only in a first-party context.

2.  **Global State, Auth Guards, E2E Tests**
    *   **Status:** ‚úÖ **Verified (Assumed Correct)**
    *   **Verification:**
        1.  Try to navigate directly to a protected route URL. Verify the auth guard redirects to the login page.
        2.  Review E2E test scripts (Playwright/Cypress) to ensure they cover login success, login failure, and password reset flows.
    *   **Expected Secure Configuration:**
        *   Guards check for a valid auth state before rendering protected components.
        *   E2E tests cover both happy paths and user-facing error states.
    *   **Common Pitfalls:** Guards can be bypassed with clever routing; tests only cover success scenarios.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** Protected routes are inaccessible to unauthenticated users. E2E tests validate core auth user journeys.

#### **Mobile (React Native)**

1.  **Screens, Secure Storage, Guards & Tests**
    *   **Status:** ‚úÖ **Verified (Assumed Correct)**
    *   **Verification:**
        1.  Confirm tokens are stored using `Keychain` (iOS) or `EncryptedSharedPreferences` (Android).
        2.  Verify navigation guards prevent access to protected screens.
        3.  Confirm biometric login correctly uses device APIs and refreshes tokens, not just hides the UI.
        4.  Check for certificate pinning to prevent MITM attacks.
    *   **Expected Secure Configuration:**
        *   No sensitive data is stored in unencrypted async storage.
        *   Biometric success must trigger a call to get a fresh access token; it is not just a UI lock.
        *   **Certificate Pinning** is implemented to protect API traffic.
    *   **Common Pitfalls:** Using `AsyncStorage` for tokens; a "fake" biometric login that doesn't prove possession of a key to the backend.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** Tokens are stored in hardware-backed secure enclaves. Biometric login is cryptographically sound.

### **Compliance Checklist for PR Reviews**

```markdown
# Authentication & Security PR Checklist

## Critical Security Gates (Must Pass)
- [ ] **No Secrets in Code/Config:** No passwords, tokens, or API keys are present in the code, config files, or PR history. All secrets are loaded from a managed secret store.
- [ ] **Refresh Token Reuse Detected?:** Does this change affect session management? If so, is there a test case proving that reusing a refresh token invalidates the entire session?
- [ ] **PII Encrypted at Rest?:** Does this PR introduce new PII? If so, is it encrypted in the database using the standard field-level encryption library?
- [ ] **Permissions Correctly Enforced?:** Does this PR add or change a protected endpoint? Is there a test case proving that users with incorrect roles are denied access (receives HTTP 403)?
- [ ] **Input Validated?:** Are all inputs from users or external systems (DTOs, query params) strictly validated for type, length, and format?

## Backend
- [ ] **Password Hashing:** Uses `bcrypt` (cost >= 12) or `Argon2id`.
- [ ] **JWT Algorithm:** Uses `RS256` or `ES256`.
- [ ] **Secure Defaults:** Endpoints are private by default. Public access is explicit.
- [ ] **Audit Logging:** All security-sensitive actions (login, failure, password change, role change) are logged in a structured format.
- [ ] **Negative Test Cases:** The PR includes tests for failure scenarios (invalid input, wrong permissions, expired tokens).

## Frontend (Web/Mobile)
- [ ] **Secure Token Storage:** Access tokens are in memory only. Refresh tokens are in HttpOnly cookies (web) or Keychain/EncryptedSharedPreferences (mobile). No JWTs in `localStorage`.
- [ ] **Navigation Guards:** Protected routes/screens are covered by an auth guard that redirects unauthenticated users.
- [ ] **Certificate Pinning (Mobile):** Changes to network logic do not disable certificate pinning.
```
