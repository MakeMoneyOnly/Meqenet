1. Go to Repository Settings → Security → Code security and analysis
2. Enable "CodeQL analysis" toggle
3. Verify repository permissions
4. Re-run the workflow

#### Issue: SARIF Upload Fails
**Troubleshooting Steps**:
1. Check GitHub token permissions (`security_events:write`)
2. Verify repository has Code Scanning capability
3. Use manual upload script as fallback
4. Review workflow permissions

#### Issue: High Number of False Positives
**Solution**:
1. Review CodeQL configuration in `.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml`
2. Add appropriate exclusions for known safe patterns
3. Update query suites for fintech-specific rules
4. Consider custom CodeQL queries for domain-specific security

#### Issue: Compliance Verification Fails
**Solution**:
1. Run manual validation: `node scripts/verify-codeql-results.js`
