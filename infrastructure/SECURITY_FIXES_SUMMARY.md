- **CKV_AWS_103**: Configured HTTPS listener with TLS 1.2+ policy
- **CKV2_AWS_74**: Ensured strong ciphers (via TLS policy)

### 4. IAM Policy Security (5 issues fixed)

### 5. S3 Bucket Configuration (5 issues fixed)

- **CKV2_AWS_61**: Added lifecycle configuration for CloudTrail buckets
- **CKV2_AWS_62**: Added event notifications for CloudTrail buckets
- **CKV_AWS_144**: Implemented cross-region replication for CloudTrail buckets
- Added versioning for S3 buckets to support replication
- Created replica provider and destination bucket

### 6. KMS Key Policies (3 issues fixed)

- **CKV2_AWS_64**: Added comprehensive key policies for:
  - `aws_kms_key.secrets` (database secrets)
  - `aws_kms_key.sns` (SNS encryption)
  - `aws_kms_key.sqs` (SQS encryption)

### 7. Miscellaneous Security Issues (4 issues fixed)

- **CKV_AWS_252**: Added SNS topic for CloudTrail notifications
- **CKV_AWS_338**: Increased VPC flow logs retention from 30 to 365 days
- **CKV2_AWS_12**: Added default security group with restrictive rules
- **CKV2_AWS_5**: Documented unattached security group (by design)

## Additional Resources Created

### New IAM Roles

- `rds_enhanced_monitoring`: For RDS enhanced monitoring
- `lambda_rotation`: For Secrets Manager rotation Lambda
- `replication`: For S3 cross-region replication

### New Lambda Functions

- `rotate_secret`: Lambda function for automatic secret rotation

### New S3 Buckets

- `alb_logs`: For ALB access logging
- `cloudtrail_replica`: For cross-region replication

### New SNS Topics

- `cloudtrail_alerts`: For CloudTrail notifications
- `cloudtrail_notifications`: For S3 event notifications

### New Database Resources

- `postgres_logging` parameter group: For comprehensive database logging
- Secret rotation configuration for automatic password rotation

### New Security Resources

- WAF v2 Web ACL with managed rule sets
- ACM certificate for HTTPS
- Request validator for API Gateway

## Configuration Changes

### Provider Configuration

- Added replica provider for eu-west-1 region (cross-region replication)
- Added data sources for `aws_region` and `aws_caller_identity`

### Networking

- Restricted security group egress rules
- Configured default security group to be fully restrictive
- Increased log retention periods

### Encryption

- All KMS keys now have explicit key policies
- Enhanced encryption for all data at rest and in transit

## Compliance Improvements

### FinTech Compliance

- Enhanced logging and monitoring across all services
- Automatic secret rotation for database credentials
- Multi-region data replication for disaster recovery
- Comprehensive audit trail with CloudTrail

### Security Best Practices

- Principle of least privilege in IAM policies
- Defense in depth with WAF, HTTPS, and encryption
- Automated security controls with lifecycle policies
- Enhanced monitoring and alerting capabilities

## Testing Recommendations

After applying these fixes:

1. Run `terraform plan` to verify all resources
2. Test in a development environment first
3. Verify HTTPS redirect functionality
4. Test secret rotation Lambda function
5. Validate cross-region replication setup
6. Ensure monitoring and logging are working

## Notes

- The HTTP ingress on port 80 for ALB is intentionally kept but immediately redirects to HTTPS
- The unattached security group is intentionally designed for future use
- Lambda rotation function contains placeholder code - replace with AWS Secrets Manager rotation
  template
- Ensure proper AWS credentials and permissions for cross-region operations

## Terraform Version Requirements

- Terraform >= 1.0
- AWS Provider >= 5.0

## Checkov Result

After these fixes, the number of failed checks should be significantly reduced from 40 to a minimal
number of acceptable/documented exceptions.
