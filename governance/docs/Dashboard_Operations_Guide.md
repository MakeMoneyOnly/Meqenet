## üöÄ Deployment & Management

### Unified Deployment

**Run All Dashboards**:

```bash
# From governance directory
python deploy_governance_suite.py --mode run
```

**Scheduled Execution**:

```bash
# Set up cron job (Linux/macOS)
0 8 * * * cd /path/to/Meqenet/governance && python deploy_governance_suite.py --mode run

# Windows Task Scheduler
# Action: python.exe
# Arguments: deploy_governance_suite.py --mode run
# Start in: C:\path\to\Meqenet\governance
```

### Configuration Management

**Main Config**: `config/governance_config.yaml`

```yaml
dashboards:
  cco:
    enabled: true
    schedule_cron: '0 8 * * *'
    timeout_minutes: 10
  cfo:
    enabled: true
    schedule_cron: '0 9 1 * *' # Monthly
    timeout_minutes: 15
  # ... other dashboards
```

### Database Management

All databases are SQLite files stored in `governance/data/`:

- `compliance.db` - CCO compliance tracking
- `finops.db` - CFO financial data
- `executive_metrics.db` - CEO strategic metrics
- `technical_health.db` - CTO technology metrics
- `security_metrics.db` - CISO security data

### Report Organization

Reports are organized in `governance/reports/dashboards/`:

```
reports/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboards/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cco/          # CCO compliance reports
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ceo/          # CEO strategic reports
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cfo/          # CFO financial reports
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ciso/         # CISO security reports
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ cto/          # CTO technical reports
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ governance_execution_summary_*.md  # Overall execution summaries
```

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues**:

- **Import Errors**: Ensure all dependencies installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Database Locked**: Close any database connections before running scripts
- **Permission Errors**: Ensure write access to `reports/` and `data/` directories
- **Unicode Errors**: Scripts include safe_print() functions for Windows console compatibility

**Debug Mode**:

```bash
# Run with detailed logging
python deploy_governance_suite.py --mode run --debug
```

**Individual Script Testing**:

```bash
# Test specific dashboard
python dashboards/cco_dashboard.py --test
```

## üîß Development & Extension

### Adding New Dashboards

1. **Create Script**: Add new script to `governance/dashboards/`
2. **Update Config**: Add dashboard config to `governance_config.yaml`
3. **Database Schema**: Create new database in `governance/data/`
4. **Report Structure**: Create report directory in `reports/dashboards/`
5. **Integration**: Update `deploy_governance_suite.py` dashboard configs

### Code Standards

- **Error Handling**: Use try-catch blocks with detailed logging
- **Unicode Safety**: Include safe_print() for Windows compatibility
- **Database Management**: Use context managers for database connections
- **Configuration**: Load settings from config files, not hardcoded values
- **Logging**: Use structured logging with appropriate levels

### Testing

```bash
# Run test suite
python -m pytest governance/tests/

# Test individual dashboard
python governance/dashboards/cco_dashboard.py --validate
```

This technical guide should be used alongside the main `README.md` for complete governance framework
documentation.
