## 🚀 Quick Start

### ⚡ Automated Installation (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is using our unified setup script with built-in fallback support:

```bash
# Navigate to your Meqenet project
cd /path/to/Meqenet/governance

# Full installation (recommended)
python setup.py

# Quick setup with defaults (no prompts)
python setup.py --quick

# Simple installation (minimal dependencies, if you have issues)
python setup.py --simple
```

The setup script automatically handles dependency issues with graceful fallback:

- ✅ **Smart Dependency Detection**: Automatically detects missing packages
- ✅ **Graceful Fallback**: Switches to simple mode if full installation fails
- ✅ **Cross-platform Support**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- ✅ **Virtual Environment Aware**: Adapts installation method based on environment
- ✅ **Modern Python Packaging**: Uses latest APIs, avoids deprecated warnings
- ✅ **Complete Setup**: Creates directories, configs, and quick-start launcher
- ✅ **Validation**: Verifies installation and provides troubleshooting

After setup, run:

```bash
# Interactive launcher (from project root)
cd ..
python quick_start.py

# Or direct execution
python governance/deploy_governance_suite.py --mode run
```

### 📋 Prerequisites

**System Requirements:**

- **Python 3.9+** (Required)
- **Operating System**: Windows 10+, macOS 10.15+, or Linux Ubuntu 18.04+
- **Memory**: 4GB+ RAM (8GB recommended for ML features)
- **Storage**: 2GB+ free space
- **Network**: Internet connection for package downloads

**Optional (for advanced features):**

- Node.js 18+ (for backend integration)
- PostgreSQL 14+ (for advanced analytics)
- Redis 6+ (for caching and sessions)

### 🔧 Advanced Installation Options

#### Installation Modes

The unified `setup.py` provides multiple installation modes to handle different scenarios:

```bash
# Full installation with all features
python setup.py --include-optional

# Validate existing installation
python setup.py --validate

# Force reinstallation
python setup.py --force

# Uninstall (with backup)
python setup.py --uninstall
```

#### Manual Installation (If Needed)

If automated setup fails or you need custom configuration:

1. **Install Core Dependencies**

   ```bash
   # Minimal core packages (for simple mode)
   pip install pyyaml>=6.0 requests>=2.28.0 packaging>=21.0

   # Full dependencies (for complete features)
   pip install -r governance/requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Create Directory Structure**

   ```bash
   mkdir -p governance/{CEO,CFO,CTO,CCO,CISO}/reports
   mkdir -p governance/{config,logs,reports,unified_reports,backups}
   ```

3. **Configure Environment**

   ```bash
   # Copy configuration template
   cp governance/.env.template governance/.env

   # Edit configuration for your environment
   nano governance/.env
   ```

#### Troubleshooting Installation Issues

**Common Issues & Solutions:**

- **"ModuleNotFoundError"**: Use `python setup.py --simple` for minimal installation
- **"pkg_resources deprecated"**: Ignore - setup.py uses modern APIs with fallbacks
- **"Can't install --user in virtualenv"**: Script automatically detects and handles this
- **Permission errors**: Use virtual environment or run with appropriate permissions
- **Network timeouts**: Setup includes timeout handling and retries

**Platform-specific Notes:**

- **Windows**: Automatically detects Windows Terminal for color support
- **macOS**: Full compatibility with Homebrew Python installations
- **Linux**: Works with system Python, pyenv, and conda environments
