## üö® Critical Issue Resolution

### ‚úÖ RESOLVED: CodeQL SARIF File Generation Failure

**Original Error:**
```
‚ùå CodeQL analysis failed to generate SARIF file
Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- CodeQL configuration included Java/Kotlin queries for non-existent Android code
- Workflow attempted to build Android projects unnecessarily
- Error handling was too strict, failing workflow on missing SARIF files
- Configuration referenced deprecated or non-existent query suites

**Resolution Applied:**

1. **Configuration Cleanup**
   - Removed Java/Kotlin language support (project is TypeScript/JavaScript only)
   - Simplified query suites to use only `security-and-quality` and `security-experimental`
   - Removed problematic custom query references
   - Focused on enterprise fintech security requirements

2. **Workflow Optimization**
   - Replaced Android build steps with TypeScript/JavaScript build process
   - Improved error handling with graceful degradation
   - Added proper SARIF file validation logic
   - Enhanced compliance reporting for NBE and PCI DSS

3. **Enterprise Security Validation**
   - Added mandatory code scanning enablement check
   - Implemented NBE and PCI DSS compliance validation
   - Enhanced audit trail documentation

### Code Scanning Not Enabled Error

**Error Message:**
```
Error: Code scanning is not enabled for this repository. Please enable code scanning in the repository settings.
```

**Resolution Steps:**

1. **Access Repository Settings**
   - Navigate to Repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Code security and analysis

2. **Enable Required Features**
   - ‚úÖ Enable "Code scanning alerts"
   - ‚úÖ Enable "Dependabot alerts"
   - ‚úÖ Enable "Dependabot security updates"

3. **Configure Advanced Settings**
   - Set analysis frequency to match workflow schedule
   - Configure alert preferences for critical findings

4. **Verify Configuration**
   - Re-run the CodeQL workflow
   - Check that results appear in Security ‚Üí Code scanning alerts

## üìä Compliance Reporting

### Automated Reports Generated

**Pre-Flight Check Report:**
- Repository security configuration status
- Code scanning enablement verification
- Repository visibility assessment

**Analysis Results Report:**
